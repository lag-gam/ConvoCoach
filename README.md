AI Conversation Coach

AI-powered conversational training tool designed to help users improve their speaking skills in real time. It listens to conversations via a microphone, transcribes speech, and analyzes key aspects such as clarity, pacing, filler words, confidence, and articulation. Using advanced AI, ConvoCoach provides instant feedback and personalized coaching to help users refine their communication skills.
To make the experience immersive and engaging, ConvoCoach features a talking AI avatar that provides real-time coaching, offering verbal and visual feedback as if the user were speaking to a real conversation partner. Additionally, the tool includes a gamified progression system, where users can earn XP, level up, and unlock challenges based on their conversational improvements.
By leveraging technologies like Whisper AI for speech-to-text, GPT-4 for conversation analysis, TTS (Text-to-Speech) for voice responses, and D-ID for a talking avatar, ConvoCoach creates an interactive and engaging learning experience. Whether for public speaking, professional interviews, or everyday conversations, ConvoCoach helps users build confidence and refine their speech patterns effectively.
ðŸ’¡ Perfect for students, professionals, and anyone looking to improve their conversational fluency in a fun and structured way! ðŸš€
